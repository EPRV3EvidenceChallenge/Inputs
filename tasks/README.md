# Tasks & Projected Timeline

* ~~July 14:  Provide first data set and description of model.~~
* ~~July 19:  Deadline for any feedback with suggested modifications to model or data properties for future data sets.~~
* ~~July 21:  Provided 5 additional data sets for analysis.~~
* ~~July 21: Draft of standardized format for submitting results avaliable~~
* ~~~July 28:  Recommended Deadline to provide results in standardized format for first data set.~~
* ~~~Aug 4:  Provide updates to standardized format for submitting results~~
* ~~~Aug 4:  Attempt to provide obvious feedback (e.g., "your estimate was way off, please check that you don't have a typeo in your priors or other obvious bug")~~
* ~~Aug 11:  Deadline to submit results for all data sets-~~
* ~~Aug 14-17:  EPRV3 Meeting 
  - Breakout session #1:  Present summary of results to group; Identify any methods/implementations that may want to try making some quick changes;  Identify priorities for breakout sessions 2 & 3. 
  - Plenary summary #1:  Describe evidence challenge to full set of EPRV3 participants.
  - Breakout session #2:  Attempt to understand reasons for different from different methods;  If necessary, update some results.  Discuss potential ways to improve accuracy.
  - Plenary summary #2:  Summarize important issues identified. 
  - Breakout session #3:  Compare computational cost of methods providing high quality evidence estimates.  Discuss potential ways to improve performance.  Make action items to bring to publication.  
  - Final plenary summary:  Summarize results, lessons learned and plans for preparing publication. ~~
* ~~Sept 14:  Original deadline to submit revised results for including in publication~~
* Sept 29:  Revised deadline to submit revised results for including in publication
* Oct 29:  Target date to circulate first draft of manuscript. 

All dates are subject to change, particularly those after the EPRV3 meeting, as we will incorporate lessons learned from the exercise and feedback from the participants on where they would like the project to go.
