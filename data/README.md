# Input Data
Input Data for the EPRV3 Evidence Challenge 

This directory contains the input data sets that will be the basis for the EPRV3 Evidence Challenge.  
Each dataset will be provided as a single ASCII, space delimited file, with one line per "observations".  
Each line will have a time (in days), an estimated velocity (in m/s), and an estimated measurement uncertainty (in m/s).

For the purposes of getting started, the first data file (rvs_00001.txt) was made avaliable immediately.  
The next set of data files (2-5) was provided late July 21/early July 22, 2017, and a sixth file was provided July 23, 2017.  
We hope that EPRV3 participants will analyze each of these prior to EPRV3 meeting and comparing results during breakout sessions.
Depending on results and feedback received, we may consider adding a few additional datasets either prior or after the EPRV3 meeting.
