# Input Data
Input Data for the EPRV3 Evidence Challenge 

This directory contains the input data sets that will be the basis for the EPRV3 Evidence Challenge.  
Each dataset will be provided as a single ASCII, space delimited file, with one line per "observations".  
Each line will have a time (in days), an estimated velocity (in m/s), and an estimated measurement uncertainty (in m/s).

For the purposes of getting started, the first data file (rvs_00001.txt) is avaliable immediately.  
We plan to provide additional datasets by end of Friday, July 21, 2017.  
Feedback on the design of the evidence challenge that is received by July 19, 2017 will be considered for generating the additional datasets.
